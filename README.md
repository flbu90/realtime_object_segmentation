# realtime_object_segmentation
Realtime Object segmentation using a Intel Realsense Depth Camera

Project to run a realtime 3D object segmentation using a Intel Realsense Depth Camera. This Project is completely beta. 

To Fix:
Segmentation only works when the live-stream is interrupted
Use Gaussian Mixture Models for better segmentation
Overlay the Clustermatrix over the Camerastream matrix
